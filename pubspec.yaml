  # # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - icons/bold/
    # - static/images/svg/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Urbanist
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/urbanist/Urbanist-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/urbanist/Urbanist-Regular.ttf

        - asset: fonts/urbanist/Urbanist-Medium.ttf
